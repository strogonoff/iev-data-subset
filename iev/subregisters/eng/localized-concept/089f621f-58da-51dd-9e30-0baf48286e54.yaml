  definition: 'of an amount of a radionuclide in a particular energy state at a given
    time, the quotient of d`N` by d`t`, where d`N` is the expectation value of the
    number of spontaneous nuclear transitions from that energy state in the time interval
    d`t`:


    `A = ((d N))/((d t))`'

  notes:
  - The SI unit of activity is the reciprocal second (s^−1^) and is given the special
    name becquerel (Bq). The earlier special unit of activity, still in temporary
    use, was the curie (Ci). 1 Bq = 1 s^−1^ = 2,703 × 10^−11^ Ci approximately.
