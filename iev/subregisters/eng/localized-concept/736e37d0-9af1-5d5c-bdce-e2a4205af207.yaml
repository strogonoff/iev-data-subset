      `T` of the second order can be represented by `n^2` components `T_((i
      j))`, generally presented in the form of a square matrix, such that `T`
      attributes to the pair of vectors *`U`* and *`V`* the scalar `sum_((i , j
      = 1))^n T_((i j)) U_i V_j`, where `U_i` and `V_j` are the coordinates of
      vectors *`U`* and *`V`*.

      `n` defined by `n`-linear forms and for which the components have `n`
      indices. Tensors of order 1 are considered as vectors and tensors of order
      0 are considered as scalars.

      `T`* or `T` ou `vec vec T`. The tensor `T` with components `T_((i j))` can
      be denoted `( T_((i j)) )`.
    - >-
      `T` is defined by a real part and an imaginary part: `T = A + j B` where
      `A` and `B` are real tensors.
