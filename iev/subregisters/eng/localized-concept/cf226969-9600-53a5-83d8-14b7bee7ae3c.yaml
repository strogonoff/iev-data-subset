  definition: at a point on the surface separating two media with different thermodynamic
    temperatures, magnitude of the density of heat flow rate *stem:[φ]* divided by
    the absolute value of temperature difference Δstem:[T], thus stem:[K = ((| phi
    |))/((| Delta T |))]

  notes:
  - 1 The coefficient of heat transfer is zero for an adiabatic boundary and infinity
    for a diathermic boundary.
  - 2 The name “thermal transmittance” and the symbol stem:[U] are mainly used in
    building technology.
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of coefficient of heat transfer is watt per square metre
    kelvin, W/(m^2^·K).
