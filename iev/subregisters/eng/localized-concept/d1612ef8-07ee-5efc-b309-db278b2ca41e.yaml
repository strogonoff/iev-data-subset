  notes:
  - '`A` and d`A`′ at distance `l`, with normal vectors `n_A` and `n^( '' )_A` and
    orientation angles `θ` and `θ`′ with respect to a common optical axis, the geometric
    extent is equal to the action of all possible rays between both surface areas
    `A` and `A`′. This is expressed by the integral over the product of all projected
    area elements d`A` cos `θ` and d`A`′ cos `θ`′ weighted by the distance squared
    to account for the apparent size of the subtending surfaces areas:


    `G = (1)/((l^2)) underset(A)( int ) underset(A^( '' ))( int ) d A cos theta *
    d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' ) = int d G`


    with


    `d G \ = ((d A cos theta * d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' )))/((l^2)) = d A cos Theta
    * d omega = d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' ) * d omega^( '' ) = d G^( '' )`


    where d`Ω` and d`Ω`′ are the solid angle elements defining the angular extent
    of d`A`′ from d`A` and d`A` from d`A`′ respectively.'
