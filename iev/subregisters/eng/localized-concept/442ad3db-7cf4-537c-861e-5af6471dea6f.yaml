  definition: '`V`, vector quantity equal to the sum, for all free charge carriers
    within the volume element, of the products of electric charge and velocity, divided
    by the volume `V`:


    `J = (1)/(V) sum_((i = 1))^n Q_i v_i`


    where `n` is the number of free carriers within the volume element, `Q`~`i`~ the
    electric charge of the `i`^th^ carrier and `*v*`~`i`~ its velocity'

  notes:
  - '`J`* through any directed surface S is equal to the electric current `I` through
    that surface:


    `I = underset(S)( int ) J * e_n d A`


    where `*e*`~n~d`A` is the vector surface element.'
