  definition: '`L_v = ((d I_v))/((d A)) (1)/((cos alpha))`


    where `I`~v~ is luminous intensity, `A` is area and `α` is the angle between the
    normal to the surface at the specified point and the specified direction'

  notes:
  - '`I`~v~, in the specified direction. The luminance of the surface is then the
    integral of these luminance elements over the whole surface.


    The equation in the definition can mathematically be interpreted as a derivative
    (i.e. a rate of change of luminous intensity with projected area) and could alternatively
    be rewritten in terms of the average luminous intensity, `bar I_v`, as:


    `L_v = underset((A -&gt; 0))((lim)) ((bar I_v))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))`.


    Hence, luminance is often considered as a quotient of averaged quantities; the
    area, `A`, should be small enough so that uncertainties due to variations in luminous
    intensity within that area are negligible; otherwise, the quotient `bar L_v =
    ((bar I_v))/(A) (1)/((cos alpha))` gives the average luminance and the specific
    measurement conditions have to be reported with the result.'
  - '`E`~v~, and solid angle, `Ω`, is `L_v = ((d E_v))/((d omega)) (1)/((cos theta))`,
    where `θ` is the angle between the normal to the surface being irradiated and
    the direction of irradiation. This form is useful when the source has no surface
    (e.g. the sky, the plasma of a discharge).'
  - '`L_v = ((d Phi_v))/((d G))`, where `Φ`~v~ is luminous flux and `G` is geometric
    extent.'
  - "`A`·cos `α`, and solid angle, `Ω`:\r\n`Phi_v = ​ ∬ L_v * cos alpha d A d omega`."
  - '`G·n`^2^, where `G` is geometric extent and `n` is refractive index, is invariant,
    the quantity expressed by `L`~v~`·n`^−2^ is also invariant along the path of the
    beam if the losses by absorption, reflection and diffusion are taken as 0. That
    quantity is called "basic luminance".'
  - '`Φ`~v~. In this case, it is mathematically interpreted as a second partial derivative
    of the luminous flux at a specified point (`x`, `y`) in space in a specified direction
    (`ϑ`, `φ`) with respect to projected area, `A`·cos `α`, and solid angle, `Ω`,


    `L_v ( x , y , vartheta , phi ) = ((del^2 Phi_v ( x , y , vartheta , phi )))/((del
    A ( x , y ) * cos alpha * del omega ( vartheta , phi )))`


    where `α` is the angle between the normal to that area at the specified point
    and the specified direction.'
  - The corresponding radiometric quantity is "radiance". The corresponding quantity
    for photons is "photon radiance".
  - The luminance is expressed in candela per square metre (cd·m^−2^ = lm·m^−2^·sr^−1^).
