  notes:
  - For a given orthonormal base, a tensor `T` of the second order can be represented
    by `n^2` components `T_((i j))`, generally presented in the form of a square matrix,
    such that `T` attributes to the pair of vectors *`U`* and *`V`* the scalar `sum_((i
    , j = 1))^n T_((i j)) U_i V_j`, where `U_i` and `V_j` are the coordinates of vectors
    *`U`* and *`V`*.
  - A tensor of the second order can be defined by a bilinear form applied to two
    vectors (covariant tensor), to two linear forms (contravariant tensor), or to
    a vector and a linear form (mixed tensor). This distinction is not necessary for
    a Euclidean space. It is also possible to generalize to tensors of order `n` defined
    by `n`-linear forms and for which the components have `n` indices. Tensors of
    order 1 are considered as vectors and tensors of order 0 are considered as scalars.
  - 'A tensor is indicated by a letter symbol in bold-face sans-serif type or by two
    arrows above a letter symbol: *`T`* or `T` ou `vec vec T`. The tensor `T` with
    components `T_((i j))` can be denoted `( T_((i j)) )`.'
  - 'A complex tensor `T` is defined by a real part and an imaginary part: `T = A
    + j B` where `A` and `B` are real tensors.'
