  notes:
  - 1 Length is one of the base quantities in the International System of Quantities
    (ISQ) on which the International System of Units (SI) is based.
  - 2 The length of a curve and the distance of two points are defined in IEC 60050-102:2007
    ({{102-04-18, IEV:102-04-18}} and {{102-03-24, IEV:102-03-24}}).
  - 3 The term length is also used by convention for the greatest dimension of an
    object, as distinguished from breadth and from height or thickness.
  - 4 The coherent SI unit of length is metre, m (see IEC 60050-112:2010, {{112-02-05,
    IEV:112-02-05}}). Non-SI units used by special interest groups are ångström, Å
    (1 Å:= 10^−10^ m), and nautical mile (1 nautical mile:= 1 852 m). A unit accepted
    in use with the SI, whose value must be obtained experimentally, is astronomical
    unit, ua, approximately equal to the mean Earth-Sun distance.
