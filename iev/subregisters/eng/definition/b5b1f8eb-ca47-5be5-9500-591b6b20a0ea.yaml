  definition: quantity that determines the maximum geometric throughput of radiation
    transmitted, received or emitted in a single-pass, passive optical arrangement
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'Defining a ray as the confined radiation exchange between two subtended surface
    area elements dstem:[A] and dstem:[A]′ at distance stem:[l], with normal vectors
    stem:[n_A] and stem:[n^( '' )_A] and orientation angles stem:[θ] and stem:[θ]′
    with respect to a common optical axis, the geometric extent is equal to the action
    of all possible rays between both surface areas stem:[A] and stem:[A]′. This is
    expressed by the integral over the product of all projected area elements dstem:[A] cos stem:[θ]
    and dstem:[A]′ cos stem:[θ]′ weighted by the distance squared to account for the
    apparent size of the subtending surfaces areas:


    stem:[G = (1)/((l^2)) underset(A)( int ) underset(A^( '' ))( int ) d A cos theta
    * d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' ) = int d G]


    with


    stem:[d G \ = ((d A cos theta * d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' )))/((l^2)) = d A cos
    Theta * d omega = d A^( '' ) cos theta^( '' ) * d omega^( '' ) = d G^( '' )]


    where dstem:[Ω] and dstem:[Ω]′ are the solid angle elements defining the angular
    extent of dstem:[A]′ from dstem:[A] and dstem:[A] from dstem:[A]′ respectively.'
  - '"Single-pass" means that the term applies only for radiation transfer in a single
    defined direction. It does not apply to devices such as Fabry–Pérot cavities.'

  - The geometric extent is expressed in square metre times steradian (m^2^·sr).
