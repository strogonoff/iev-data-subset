data:
  definition: maximum tube load specified by the manufacturer for stated operating
    factors, the waveform of the X-ray tube voltage being such that coefficient stem:[f]
    = 1
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'There are two maximum ratings:


    a) The 2.5 h rating: This is the maximum rated tube load of an X-ray tube for
    a time of 2.5 h given by the manufacturer for various types of use (assembly in
    a shield, artificial cooling, use with long cables, etc.).


    b) Temporary use: Unless indicated otherwise this is the maximum rated tube load
    permitted for a time of 0.1 s and for a coefficient stem:[f] = 1.'
