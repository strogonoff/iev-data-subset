      notes:
        - >-
          `T` of the second order can be represented by `n^2` components `T_((i
          j))`, generally presented in the form of a square matrix, such that
          `T` attributes to the pair of vectors *`U`* and *`V`* the scalar
          `sum_((i , j = 1))^n T_((i j)) U_i V_j`, where `U_i` and `V_j` are the
          coordinates of vectors *`U`* and *`V`*.
        - >-
          `n` defined by `n`-linear forms and for which the components have `n`
          indices. Tensors of order 1 are considered as vectors and tensors of
          order 0 are considered as scalars.
        - >-
          `T`* or `T` ou `vec vec T`. The tensor `T` with components `T_((i j))`
          can be denoted `( T_((i j)) )`.
        - >-
          `T` is defined by a real part and an imaginary part: `T = A + j B`
          where `A` and `B` are real tensors.
