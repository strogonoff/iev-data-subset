          1 The coefficient of heat transfer is zero for an adiabatic boundary
          and infinity for a diathermic boundary.
        - '`U` are mainly used in building technology.'
        - >-
          3 The coherent SI unit of coefficient of heat transfer is watt per
          square metre kelvin, W/(m^2^·K).
